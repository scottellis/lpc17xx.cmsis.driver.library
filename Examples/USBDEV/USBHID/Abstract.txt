@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use USBDEV on LPC1768 to run a simple HID application.
	Process:			                                                  
		Clock Settings:
		   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
		   - PLL                    =  400 MHz
		   - processor clock = CCLK =  100 MHz
		   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
		   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  25 MHz

		It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
		  -  LEDs (LEDs controlled by P1.28, P1.29, P1.31, P2.2-6)
		  -  Push Button (INT0)
		
		The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
		which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
		and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
		through a custom HID Client Program.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested only on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- LED: ON
				- INT1: ON
				- D+: DEVICE
				- D-: DEVICE
				- UMODE: 1-2 (USB)
				- E/U: 1-2 (USB)
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
	
	Running mode:
		RAM mode:   This example can be run on RAM mode with debugger. 
					All files must be build to .elf file, this file will be loaded into RAM through a 
					debugger tool before running 
		ROM(FLASH)mode: This example can be run on ROM mode with debugger or standalone after burning. 
					All files in each example must be built to .hex file. This file will be burned into 
					ROM(Flash) memory through an external tool (i.e: Flash Magic...) befor running.
					
					Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
					to be connected:
					- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
						+ RST: ON
						+ ISP: ON
					- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
						+ RST_E: ON
						+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Hit reset button to run example.
		- Step 5: After see UGL(USB Good Link) led on board turn on, run HIDClient application
				  by clicking HIDClient.ext at USBHID\app folder
		- Step 6: Chose "LPC17xx HID" device.
		- Step 7: Click in any boxes on Outputs (LEDs) to turn on/off 8 LEDs on board
		- Step 8: Hit INT1 button and see if Inputs(BUTTON) box-0 turn on or not
		
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > USBDEV > USBHID"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
