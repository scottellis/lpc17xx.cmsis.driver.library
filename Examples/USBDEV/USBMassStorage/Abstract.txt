@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to write a simple USB Mass Storage application on LPC1768.
	Process:
		The MassStorage project is a Mass Storage simple demo run on LPC1768		                                                
		Clock Settings:
		   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
		   - PLL                    =  400 MHz
		   - processor clock = CCLK =  100 MHz
		   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
		   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  25 MHz
		
		It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.		
		The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
		running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- LED: ON
				- INT1: ON
				- D+: DEVICE
				- D-: DEVICE
				- UMODE: 1-2 (USB)
				- E/U: 1-2 (USB)
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- USB_D- : 1-2 (USB device is active)
				- USB_D+ : 1-2 (USB device is active)
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
	
	Running mode:
		RAM mode:   This example can be run on RAM mode with debugger. 
					All files must be build to .elf file, this file will be loaded into RAM through a 
					debugger tool before running 
		ROM(FLASH)mode: This example can be run on ROM mode with debugger or standalone after burning. 
					All files in each example must be built to .hex file. This file will be burned into 
					ROM(Flash) memory through an external tool (i.e: Flash Magic...) befor running.
					
					Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
					to be connected:
					- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
						+ RST: ON
						+ ISP: ON
					- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
						+ RST_E: ON
						+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Hit reset button to run example.
		- Step 5: After see UGL(USB Good Link). Open My Computer, you will see 'LPC17xx' disk.
		- Step 6: Open this disk, you will see 'Readme.txt' file (it has read-only attribute)
		- Step 7: Try to copy/delete another file into disk to test if Mass Storage is work well or not
		
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > USBDEV > USBMassStorage"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
