@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use USBDEV on LPC1768 to demo the virtual COM port.
	Process:	                                                 
		Clock Settings:
		   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
		   - PLL                    =  400 MHz
		   - processor clock = CCLK =  100 MHz
		   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
		   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  25 MHz
		
		The PC will install a virtual COM port on the PC (see Driver Installation).
		After installation an additional port "LPC17xx USB VCom Port(COMx)"
		can be found under System/Hardware/Device Manager/Ports(COM&LPT).
		Number "x" is not fixed as different PC configuration may have different 
		"x" displayed on the device manager. The USB host driver assigns "x" 
		dynamically based on the existing COM port configuration of the system.
		
		Testing the USB Virtual COM port with serial cable:

  		Open two Hyperterminal windows. 
      		One with "LPC17xx USB VCom Port(COMx)" 
      		One with "Communications Port (COM1)".
  		Connect PC port COM1 to the comport on the board and open "COM1" 
  		and "COMx". Data from COM1 will be echoed on "COMx" and visa versa. 
  		So, this is bi-directional communication between the physical COM
  		port 0 or 1 on the board and the virtual COM port COMx on host PC.
  		By default, COM PORT1 on the board is used for VirtualCOM port test.
  		In order to use COM PORT0 on the board, modify the definition PORT_NUM
  		from 1 to 0 in serial.h, recompile and reprogram the flash. RST jumper
  		needs to removed to start the Virtual COM port test.     
		
@Driver Installation:
     "Welcome to the Found New Hardware Wizard" appears
     - select 'No, not this time'
     - press  'Next'

     - select 'Install from a list or specific location (Advanced)'
     - press  'Next'

     - select 'Search for the best driver in these locations'
     - check  'include this location in the serach'
     - set to <project folder>
     - press 'Next'

     "Hardware Installation" appears
     "has not passed Windows Logo testing..."
     - press 'Continue Anyway'

     "Completing the Found New Hardware Wizard" appears
     - press 'Finish'

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested only on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- D+: DEVICE
				- D-: DEVICE
				- UMODE: 1-2 (USB)
				- E/U: 1-2 (USB)
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Hit reset button to run example. (install driver if required)
		- Step 5: After see UGL(USB Good Link) led on board turn on, open Device Manager > Ports (COM & LPT)
				  see if "LPC17xx USB Vcom Port (COMx)" appears or not. 
		- Step 6: Open one HyperTerminal for COM1 and other for COMx with below configuration:
					- 9600 bps
					- 8 data bits
					- none parity
					- 1 stop bit
					- None flow control
		- Step 7: Sure that you already connected COM1 port on board with PC. Type any character on 
				one HyperTerminal screen and see this character will be echoed in other screen and vice versa 
		
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > USBDEV > USBCDC"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
