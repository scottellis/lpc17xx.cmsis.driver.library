@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how uses I2C as master device to transfer data 
		from/to I2C slave device
	Process:
		 I2C0 is configured as slave and I2C2 is configured as master. Both I2C using polling mode.
		 I2C Clock Rate is set at 100K.
		 UART0 is configure for display transmit process.
		 		
		After reset software will run the following steps: 		
		- First, the master transmit to slave a number of data bytes
		- Then, the master receive a number of data bytes from slave.
		- Finally, the master send two bytes to slave, send repeat start immediately 
		and receive from slave a number of data byte.

	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	 
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	i2c_master_slave_int_test.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
		I2C connection:
			For I2C0:
				- SDA -> P0.27
				- SCL -> P0.28
			For I2C2:
				- SDA -> P0.10
				- SCL -> P0.11
		SDA pin of I2C master connects to SDA pin of I2C slave peripheral
		SCL pin of I2C master connects to SCL pin of I2C slave peripheral
				
	Serial display configuration:(e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bit 
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Choose I2C peripheral for master and slave by setting 'USEDI2CDEV_M' and 'USEDI2CDEV_S'
		- Step 2: Build example.
		- Step 3: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 4: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 5: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 6: Run example, and see the result in UART display tool.
		
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > I2C > Master_Slave_Interrupt"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
