@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use I2S as slave device to communicate with I2S 
		master device in polling mode
		Note that: this example will run combine with slave example at folder \slave.
		(Pls see "Step to run" part in this file for more information)
	Process:
		This example uses I2C as master device to transfer data from/to I2C slave device
		- First, the slave receive from master a number of data bytes
		- Then, the slave transmit a number of data bytes to master.
		- Finally, the master send two bytes to slave, send repeat start immediately 
		and receive from slave a number of data byte.
		- Using in polling mode.
		
		UART0 is configure for display message and control I2C.		 		
		After reset UART0 will send the welcome message and guide user how to control 
		the I2C transmition and reception via UART
		
@Directory contents:
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	slave.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			
			
		I2C connection:
			If using I2C0: 
				- SDA -> P0.27
				- SCL -> P0.28
			If using I2C2
				- SDA -> P0.10
				- SCL -> P0.11
			SDA pin on master connects with SDA pin on slave
			SCL pin on master connects with SCL pin on slave
				
	Serial display configuration:(e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bit 
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Choose what I2C peripheral use in this case by setting "USEDI2CDEV_M"
			+ If using I2C0, setting
				#define USEDI2CDEV_M	0
			+ If using I2C2, setting
				#define USEDI2CDEV_M	2
		- Step 2: Build example.				
		- Step 3: Burn hex file into slave board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 4: Choose correct working board and I2C peripheral in \master\master.c file
				  Build and burn this example into master board (if run on ROM mode)		
		- Step 5: Connect UART0 on master and slave boards to COM ports on your computer
		- Step 6: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 7: Run example
					+ Hit reset button on slave board
					+ At slave side: Press '1' to start
					+ Hit reset button on master board
					+ At master side: 
						- Press '1' to transmit
						- Press '2' to receive
						- Press '3' to transmit, then repeat start and receive

		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
