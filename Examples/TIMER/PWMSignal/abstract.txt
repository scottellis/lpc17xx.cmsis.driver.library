@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use TIMERs to generate PWM signals with 
		different duty cycles.
	Process:
		In this case, use 4 TIMERs with match channel 0 to generate 4 PWM signal with
		4 duty cycles:
		- TIME0: Match channel 0 (MAT0.0 - P1.28)
			+ HIGH state: 100 (100*100 = 10000us = 10ms)
			+ LOW state: 700 (70ms)
			So duty cycle = 100/800 = 12.5%
		- TIME1: Match channel 0 (MAT1.0 - P1.22)
			+ HIGH state: 200 (20ms)
			+ LOW state: 600 (60ms)
			So duty cycle = 200/800 = 25%
		- TIMER2: Match channel 0 (MAT2.0: P0.6)
			+ HIGH state: 300 (30ms)
			+ LOW state: 500 (50ms)
			So duty cycle = (300/800) = 37.5%
		- TIMER3: Match channel 0 (MAT3.0 - P0.10)
			+ HIGH state: 800 (80ms)
			+ LOW state: 800 (80ms)
			So duty cycle = (800/1600) = 50%
		Using oscilloscope to observe these signals

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested only on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
		Serial display configuration:(e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example, see the welcome screen on serial display and observe 
				  4 signals on oscilloscope:
				  - P1.28: duty cycle = 12.5%
				  - P1.22: duty cycle = 25%
				  - P0.6:  duty cycle = 37.5%
				  - P0.10: duty cycle = 50%
