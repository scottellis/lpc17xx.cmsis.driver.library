@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to configure I2S peripheral to communication
		between two board.
	Process:
		I2S setup:
			- wordwidth: 16 bits
			- stereo mode
			- master mode for TX and slave mode for RX
			- ws_haftword = 31
			- frequency = 44.1Khz (maximum is 96kHz)
		This setup can be changed to test with other config.
		
		I2S peripheral on transmit board will send infinite data to I2S peripheral on receive board.
		Data will be increase after each transmittion.
		
		tx_depth_irq = rx_depth_irq = 4.
		So whenever FIFO is haft full, it will create IRQ request, I2S interrupt service routine 
		"I2S_IRQHandler()" will be called to send/receive data.
		
		Open serial terminal to observe I2S transfer process.
		
		Pls note that because I2S is the protocol for audio data transfer, so sometime it has dummy data
		while FIFO transmit is empty. These data are not importance and they can be ignored when verify.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
		I2S connection:
		- P0.4(J.116)-I2SRX_CLK on first board connects to P0.7(J.112)-I2STX_CLK on second board.
		- P0.5(J.115)-I2SRX_WS  on first board connects to P0.8(J.111)-I2STX_WS  on second board.
		- P0.6(J.113)-I2SRX_SDA on first board connects to p0.9(J.109)-I2STX_SDA on second board.
		Common ground must be connected together between two board.
				
	Serial display configuration:(e.g: , TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bit 
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Setting: "I2S_TRANSMIT = 1", build example and burn hex file into transmit board.
		- Step 2: Setting: "I2S_TRANSMIT = 0", build example and burn hex file into receive board.
		Note that receive program also can run on RAM mode with debugger if you want.
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on receive board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example and observe data on serial display
					+ Run receive board first
						- Press '1' to start I2S operation
					+ Then, hit reset button on transmit board
					
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > I2S > I2S_two_kit"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
