@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use I2S to transfer data in interrupt mode
	Process:
		I2S setup:
			- wordwidth: 16 bits
			- stereo mode
			- master mode for TX and slave mode for RX
			- ws_haftword = 31
			- frequency = 44.1Khz (maximum is 96kHz)
		This setup can be changed to test with other config.
		Source data are initialized at 'I2S_BUFFER_SRC' and will be copy to 'I2S_BUFFER_DST'
		by I2S peripheral.
		Transfer size = 0x400 bytes
		rx_depth_irq = 1
		tx_depth_irq = 8
		First, I2S transmit channel will send data to I2S receive channel, when I2S receive data,
		it generate interrupt, I2S_IRQHandler service routine will be called to receive data and 
		save it into I2SRXBuffer.
		After transmittion finish, "Buffer_Verify()" will check RX and TX buffer data. The result
		will be print out serial display.  
		
		Pls note that because I2S is the protocol for audio data transfer, so sometime it has dummy data
		while FIFO transmit is empty. These data are not importance and they can be ignored when verify.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
		I2S connection:
		I2S-RX connects to I2S-TX as following:
		- P0.4-I2SRX_CLK connects to P0.7-I2STX_CLK
		- P0.5-I2SRX_WS  connects to P0.8-I2STX_WS
		- P0.6-I2SRX_SDA connects to p0.9-I2STX_SDA
				
	Serial display configuration:(e.g: , TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bit 
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example, observe data on serial display 
					
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > I2S > I2S_IRQ"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
