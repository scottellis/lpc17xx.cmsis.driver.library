@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use I2S master clock as I2S clock source
	Process:
		I2S setup:
			- wordwidth: 16 bits
			- stereo mode
			- master mode for TX and slave mode for RX
			- ws_haftword = 31
			- frequency = 44.1Khz (maximum is 96kHz)
		I2S Clock setting:
			- Transmitter:
				+ Select the RX fractional rate divider clock ouput as the source
				+ Disable 4-wire mode
				+ Enable TX_MCLK output (this setting is optional, just used to observe 
				  this clock on oscilloscope)
			- Receiver:
				+ Select the TX_MCLK signal as RX_MCLK clock source
				+ Disable 4-wire mode
				+ Disable RX_MCLK output 
		Clock calculate formula:
			MCLK = I2S_freq * (bitrate + 1) 
			bitrate = channel * wordwidth - 1
		Ex: a 48 kHz sample rate for 16-bit stereo data will have master clock:
			MCLK = 48K * 16 * 2 = 1.536Mhz
			
		This example sets I2S receiver use MCLK from I2S transmitter. So we not must have to connect wire 
		between I2SRX_CLK and I2STX_CLK.
		I2S transmit data in interrupt mode. After finished, received and transmited buffer will be verified,
		the result will be print out serial display.		
		
		Pls note that because I2S is the protocol for audio data transfer, so sometime it has dummy data
		while FIFO transmit is empty. These data are not importance and they can be ignored when verify.

	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
		I2S connection (uses MCLK share inside):
		I2S-RX connects to I2S-TX as following:
		- P0.5-I2SRX_WS  connects to P0.8-I2STX_WS
		- P0.6-I2SRX_SDA connects to p0.9-I2STX_SDA
				
	Serial display configuration:(e.g: , TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bit 
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example, observe data on serial display 
					
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > I2S > I2S_MCLK"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
