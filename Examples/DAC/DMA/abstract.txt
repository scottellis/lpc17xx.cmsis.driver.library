@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use DMA to transfer data to DAC peripheral
	Process:
		DAC will be initialized with maximum current is 700uA. This allows a maximum update rate of 1Mhz
		Formula for ouput voltage on AOUT is: 
			AOUT = VALUE x ((Vrefp - Vrefn)/1024)+Vrefn
		in which:
		- Vrefp: tied to VDD(3.3V)
		- Vrefn: tied to Vss
		
		GPDMA channel 0 is configured in this example.
		GPDMA channel 0 will tranfer "dac_value" to DAC peripheral. DAC updated values have range 
		from 0 to 0x3FF. So AOUT ouput voltage will change from: Vss to VDD.
		
		Observe AOUT(P0.26) signal by oscilloscope.

	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	 
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	dac_dma.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Run example and observe AOUT(P0.26) signal by oscilloscope
		
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > DAC > DMA"
		for more details)
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
