@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use DMA to generate a sinewave signal
	Process:
		DAC will be initialized with maximum current is 700uA. This allows a maximum update rate of 1Mhz
		Formula for ouput voltage on AOUT is: 
			AOUT = VALUE x ((Vrefp - Vrefn)/1024)+Vrefn
		in which:
		- Vrefp: tied to VDD(3.3V)
		- Vrefn: tied to Vss
		
		DAC will generate a sinewave with peak to peak is within Vrefp and Vrefn. We need to prepare a
		look up table with 60 items, each item is the value to update AOUT voltage, and it's correspondent
		to a sample point of 1 circle sinewave signal. The formula is below:
			for(i=0;i<NUM_SINE_SAMPLE;i++) //NUM_SINE_SAMPLE = 60
			{
				dac_sine_lut[i] = 512 + 512*sin(i);
				dac_sine_lut[i] = (dac_sine_lut[i]<<6);
			}
		  
		GPDMA channel 0 is configured in this example and used to transfer dac_sine_lut[i] to DAC peripheral.
		When the last item of dac_sine_lut is transfered, GPDMA will roll back to transfer the first item.
			
		DAC is configured to use time out for each DAC value update and trigger GPDMA to fill DAC value register.
		This time out value can also be used to calculate the sinewave frequency:
			time out = (PCLK_DAC_IN_MHZ*1000000)/(SINE_FREQ_IN_HZ*NUM_SINE_SAMPLE);
			Where:	- PCLK_DAC_IN_MHZ = 25
					- SINE_FREQ_IN_HZ = 60
					- NUM_SINE_SAMPLE = 60
		
		Observe AOUT(P0.26) signal by oscilloscope.

	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	 
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	dac_sinewave_test.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
		Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Run example and observe AOUT(P0.26) signal by oscilloscope
		
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > DAC > SineWave"
		for more details)
