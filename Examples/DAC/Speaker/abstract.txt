@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to test DAC through speaker
	Process:
		DAC will be initialized with maximum current is 700uA. 
		Formula for ouput voltage on AOUT is: 
			AOUT = VALUE x ((Vrefp - Vrefn)/1024)+Vrefn
		in which:
		- Vrefp: tied to VDD(3.3V)
		- Vrefn: tied to GND
		The DAC peripheral will generate the sin tone, in which will increase step by step to max and 
		reduce to 0 and continue to increase to max again in the same frequency continuously. 
		We are able to hear the tone from the speaker for many cycles.
			
@Directory contents:
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	dac_speaker.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- SPK: ON (speaker)
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				Listen through headphone port
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Run example, hear sound from speaker/headphone and observe AOUT signal (P0.26) by oscilloscope
		
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > DAC > Speaker"
		for more details)
				
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
