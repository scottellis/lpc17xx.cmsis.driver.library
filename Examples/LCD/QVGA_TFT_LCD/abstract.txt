@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to configure LCD on MCB1700 board
	Process:
		This example uses Graphic LCD driver library that derivered by Keil.
		Using SPI protocol to communicate with LCD controller chip.
		This example just uses LCD driver to display simple text on LCD screen.

@Directory contents:
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	
	Font_24x16.h: Data of font 24x16
	GLCD_SPI_LPC1700.c: LPC1700 low level Graphic LCD driven with SPI functions
	GLCD.h: Graphic LCD function prototypes and defines 
	lcdtest.c: Main program
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	
@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Run example, see simple text displays on LCD screen
		          
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > LCD > QVGA_TFT_LCD"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
