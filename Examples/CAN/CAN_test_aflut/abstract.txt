@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use CAN driver functions for setup and change AFLUT table dynamically.
	Process:
		Using 2 CAN peripheral CAN1 and CAN2 to test CAN operation.
		This example supports all kind of identifier: FullCAN, explicit or group format.
		Both CAN1 and CAN2 are set baudrate at 125KHz.
		First, settup AF look-up table with 5 sections:
			- 6 entries for FullCAN section
			- 6 entries for Standard Frame Format (SFF) section
			- 6 entries for Group Standard Frame Format (SFF_GRP) section
			- 6 entries for Extended Frame Format (EFF) section
			- 6 entries for Group Extended Frame Format (EFF_GRP) section
		Initialize 10 messages:
			- 1st message with 11-bit ID which exit in AF Look-up Table in FullCAN Section
			- 2nd message with 11-bit ID which not exit in AF Look-up Table 
			- 3th message with 11-bit ID which exit in AF Look-up Table in SFF Section
			- 4th message with 11-bit ID which not exit in AF Look-up Table
			- 5th message with 11-bit ID which exit in AF Look-up Table in Group SFF Section
			- 6th message with 11-bit ID which not exit in AF Look-up Table
			- 7th message with 29-bit ID which exit in AF Look-up Table in EFF Section
			- 8th message with 29-bit ID which not exit in AF Look-up Table
			- 9th message with 29-bit ID which exit in AF Look-up Table in Group of EFF Section
			- 10th message with 29-bit ID which not exit in AF Look-up Table
		Then, send 10 messages from CAN1 to CAN2, whenever CAN2 receive message that has ID exit in its AFLUT, CAN
		receive interrupt occurs, CAN interrupt service routine "CAN_IRQHandler" will be invoked to receive message 
		and save it in array "AFRxMsg[]".
		In this case, message 1,3,5,7,9 will be received.
		After that, "CAN_ChangeAFTable" function will be called to load and remove entries in AFLUT in such a way as 
		to receive messages 2,4,6,9,10 instead of 1,3,5,7,9.
		Re-send 10 messages and re-received messages to check if AFLUT operation correct or not.
		
		Open serial display window to observe CAN transfer processing.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested only on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
		CAN connection:
			- CAN1-Pin2 connects to CAN2-Pin2 (CAN-L)
			- CAN1-Pin7 connects to CAN2-Pin7 (CAN-H)
				
		Serial display configuration:(e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example:
			- Press "1" to initialize message and AFLUT 
			- Press "2" to start CAN operation
			- Press "3" to display received messages
			- Press "4" to change AFLUT
			- Press "5" to re-send message
			- Press "6" to display received messages

		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
