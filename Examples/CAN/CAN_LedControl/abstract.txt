@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use CAN frames to control LED display.
	Process:
		Using 2 CAN peripheral CAN1 and CAN2 to test CAN operation.
		Two CAN used in bypass mode.
		User will enter LED display value on serial display and this value will be saved
		in TXMsg, this message will be sent from CAN1 to CAN2.
		When CAN2 receive this message, it will display LEDs according to value in this 
		message.
			
@Directory contents:
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	 
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	can_ledcontrol.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested only on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
		CAN connection:
			- CAN1-Pin2 connects to CAN2-Pin2 (CAN-L)
			- CAN1-Pin7 connects to CAN2-Pin7 (CAN-H)
				
		Serial display configuration:(e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example:
			- Press LED value on serial display. This value should be in range: 0x00 - 0xFF
			- See LED displaying on board.

		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
