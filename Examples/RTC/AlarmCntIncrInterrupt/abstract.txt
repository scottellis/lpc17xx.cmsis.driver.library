@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to generate interrupt in Second 
		Counter Increment Interrupt (1s) and generate Alarm interrupt at 10s
	Process:
		After initialize RTC, set current time for RTC with this value:
		8:00:00PM, 2009-04-24
		And set Alarm time at 10s
		RTC is set generate interrupt each second, so each 1s it will call 
		RTC_IRQHandler( ), it will get time from RTC register and display on
		serial screen. It all check if alarm match interrupt occurs or not.
		(This interrupt just only occurs at 10s). So after 10s, alarm interrupt
		occurs and a notice sentence will be wirte on serial display screen.

@Directory contents:
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	rtc_alarm_cntincr_int.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- VBAT: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
	Serial display configuration:(e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bit 
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode) 
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example and observe data from serial display
		
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > RTC > AlarmCntIncrInterrupt" 
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
