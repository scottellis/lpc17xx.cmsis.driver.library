@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to test Motor Control PWM module in LPC17xx.
	Process:
		Tested function on MCPWM could be: 
			- 3-phase AC mode: inverted output is enable, A0 and A1 output pin is internally routed to A0 signal
			- 3-phase DC mode: inverted output is enable
			- capture on Motor Control: in this case is used to detect the falling edge on MCO0B output pin.
		  		The MCFB0 input pin therefore must be connected to MCO0B.
					+ Capture Channel 0.
					+ Capture falling edge on MCFB0 input pin.
					+ Interrupt enabled on capture event.
		
		Channel 0,1,2 will be configured as follows:
			- edge aligned operation 
			- polarity pin: Passive state is LOW, active state is HIGH
			- disable dead time
			- enable update value
			- period time = 300
			- pulse width value:
				+ channel 0 = 0
				+ channel 1 = 100
				+ channel 2 = 200
		The program will update the value for pulse width for 3 channel continuously from 0 to 300, increase 20 
		each update time. After each update, the serial will write "Update!" into screen.
		After that, 'CapFlag' will be checked if detect falling edge on MCO0B or not.
		If yes, the program will print the current capture value into screen.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- AD0.2: ON
				- LED: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF

			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
		MCPWM connection:
			- For the capture function, pin MCFB/MCI0 (P1.20) must be connected with pin MC0B (P1.22)
			to capture the pulse-width of signal output of MC0B from the beginning to
			the falling edge.			
			- The output signal can be observed by oscilloscope on these pins below:
				+ P1.19 - MC0A
				+ P1.22 - MC0B
				+ P1.25 - MC1A
				+ P1.26 - MC1B
				+ P1.28 - MC2A
				+ P1.29 - MC2B
				
		Serial display configuration:(e.g: , TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 		
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Chose MCPWM mode that want to test
			+ If want to test 3-phase DC mode, setting: 
					#define DC_MODE_TEST	1
			+ If want to test 3-phase AC mode, setting:
					#define AC_MODE_TEST	1
			+ If want to test Capture MCPWM mode, setting:
					#define CAPTURE_MODE_TEST	1
			(Should not enable DC mode and AC mode at the same time)
		- Step 2: Build example.
		- Step 3: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 4: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 5: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 6: Run example. See capture result on serial display (if use Capture mode)
				  And use oscilloscope to monitor the wave form.
		
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > MCPWM > MCPWMSimple"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
