@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to enter system in Deep PowerDown mode and wake-up 
		by using RTC (Real-time clock) interrupt
	Process:
		When system enter in Deep PowerDown mode, it just can be waked up when an external 
		reset signal is applied, or the RTC interrupt is enabled and an RTC interrupt is
		generated.
		In this case, we can use both RTC interrupt or hit RESET button to wake-up system
		RTC configure:
			- Alarm time: 5s
		So, after each 5s, RTC will generate Alarm interrupt to wake up system. 
					
@Directory contents:
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	rtc_deeppwd.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested only on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
		Serial display configuration:(e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example and observe on serial display
					+ Press '1' to enter system in Deep PowerDown mode
					and wait 5s to RTC wake-up system automatically or press 
					"RESET" button to wake it up immediatly.

		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
