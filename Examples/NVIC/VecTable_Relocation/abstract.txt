@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to relocation vetor table.
	Process:
		Vector Table will be remapped at new address VTOR_OFFSET.
		In ROM mode: Vector Table will be initialized at 0x00000000
		In RAM mode: Vector Table will be initialized at 0x10000000
		So, we need copy vector table from init address to new address.
		Check VT remapping is successful or not, use SysTick interrupt to blink LEDs on board.
					
@Directory contents:
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	vt_relocation.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
		Serial display configuration:(e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example and see LED P1.28 blink or not.
				  If it is blinking, Vector Table remapping is successful.

@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
