@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use SPI as master to connect with SPI slave
		Note that: this example will run combine with slave example at folder \Slave.
		(Pls see "Step to run" part in this file for more information)
	Process:
		SPI configuration:
			- CPHA = 0: data is sampled on the second clock edge of SCK.
			- CPOL = 1: SCK is active low
			- Clock rate = 2MHz
			- LSBF = 0: SPI data is transferred MSB first 
			- BITS = 10: 10 bits per transfer
			- MSTR = 1: SPI operates in Master mode
		Using SSEL as GPIO pin to handler chip select signal via 'CS_Force( )' function.
		After initialize buffer, SPI master will transfer/receive data to/from SPI slave
		in POLLING mode by calling 'SPI_ReadWrite( )' function.
		After transmittion completed, receive and transmit buffer will be compare, if they 
		are not similare, the program will be enter infinite loop and a error notice will
		be displayed.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
		SPI connection:
			- P0.15 - SCK on master connects to P0.15 - SCK on slave board;
	 		- P0.16 - SSEL on master connects to P0.16 - SSEL on slave board (used as GPIO)
	  		- P0.17 - MISO on master connects to P0.17 - MISO on slave board
	  		- P0.18 - MOSI on master connects to P0.18 - MOSI on slave board
			Common ground must be connected together between two board.
	  			
	Serial display configuration:(e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bit 
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into master board (if run on ROM mode) 
		- Step 3: Build "Slave\spi_slave" example
		- Step 4: Burn this hex file into slave board.
		- Step 5: Connect UART0 on master board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 6: Configure hardware, connect master board and slave board as above instruction 
		- Step 7: Configure serial display as above instruction
		- Step 8: Run example and observe SPI master transfer result from serial display
			+ Press '1' to start SPI transfer
			
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > SPI > Master" 
		for more details)

	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
