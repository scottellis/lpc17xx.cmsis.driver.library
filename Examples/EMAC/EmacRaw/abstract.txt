@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to test EMAC driver with raw packet frame format
		that is not related with any upper-layer (i.e. TCP/IP...).
	Process:
		There are two ways to test:
		- TX_ONLY and BOUNCE_RX flags can be set one at a time, not both.
		When TX_ONLY is set to 1, it's a TX_ONLY packet from the MCB1700
		board to the LAN. Use the traffic analyzer such as ethereal, once
		the program is running, the packets can be monitored on the traffic
		analyzer.
		- When BOUNCE_RX is set to 1 (TX_ONLY needs to reset to 0), it's a
		test to test both TX and RX, use the traffic generator/analyzer,
		you can creat a packet with the destination address as that on the
		MCB1700 board, use the traffic generator to send packets, as long
		as the destination address matches, MCB1700 will reverse the source
		and destination address and send the packets back on the network.
		ENABLE_WOL flag is used to test power down and WOL functionality.
		BOUNCE_RX flag needs to be set to 1 when WOL is being tested.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:	
		This example is tested on:	
			Keil MCB1700 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON
				- VBUS: ON
				- LED: ON
				- E/C: 2-3 (Ethernet)
				- E/U: 2-3 (Ethernet)
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depending of power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- ACC_IRQ/LED2: 2-3 (LED2)
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
		Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run only on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Choose correct working board by uncomment correct defined board in lpc17xx_emac.h file
			+ If using MCB1700 board, uncomment "#define MCB_LPC_1768"
			+ If using IAR-LPC1768-KS board, uncomment "#define MCB_LPC_1768"
			(Should not uncomment both symbols at the same time)
		- Step 2: setting flag (in emactest.c):
				 	- TX_ONLY = 1
					- BOUNCE_RX = 0 
				  Build example and burn into first board.
		- Step 3: setting flag:
					- TX_ONLY = 0
					- BOUNCE_RX = 1
				  Build example and burn into second board.
		- Step 4: Use CrossOver cable to connect two boards.
		- Step 5: Connect UART0 on two boards to COM ports on your computer.
		- Step 6: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction. 
		- Step 7: Hit reset button on two boards.
		- Step 8: Wait for EMAC initilization completes on two board.
		- Step 9: If ENABLE_WOL is enabled on board 'BOUNCE_RX' side, after initializing EMAC,
				  it will enter sleep mode to be waked-up on LAN (WoL).
		- Step 10: On 'TX_ONLY' side, hit INT0 button to send a frame.
		- Step 11: After receiving frame, 'BOUNCE_RX' side will be waked-up and operates
				   properly.

		for more details)
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
