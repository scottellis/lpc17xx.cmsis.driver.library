@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to generate PWM signal on 3 Channels in both 
		edge mode and single mode.
	Process:
		This program illustrates the PWM signal on 3 Channels in both edge mode
		and single mode.
		Peripheral clock for PWM: PWM_PCLK = CCLK / 4 = 72MHz/4 = 18MHz and there is no
		prescale for PWM. The PWM timer/counter clock is at 18MHz. The base rate is set to 100
		The base PWM frequency is at 18MHz/100 = 180 KHz.
		Each PWM channel will be configured as following:
			- Channel 2: Double Edge (P2.1)
			- Channel 4: Double Edge (P2.5)
			- Channel 5: Single Edge (P2.6)
		The Match register values are as follows:
			- MR0 = 100 (PWM rate)
			- MR1 = 41, MR2 = 78 (PWM2 output)
			- MR3 = 53, MR4 = 27 (PWM4 output)
			- MR5 = 65 (PWM5 output)
		PWM Duty on each PWM channel:
			- Channel 2: Set by match 1, Reset by match 2.
			- Channel 4: Set by match 3, Reset by match 4.
			- Channel 5: Set by match 0, Reset by match 5.
		Using Oscilloscope to observe the PWM signals

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			
			PWM Pin selected:
				Observe PWM wave signal on these pin
				- PWM1.2 (channel 2): P2.1
				- PWM1.4 (channel 4): P2.3
				- PWM1.5 (channel 5): P2.4
								
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Run example, Use oscilloscope to monitor the wave form
		
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > PWM > Dual_Edge"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
