@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use PWM signal on 6 Channels in single edge mode
	Process:
		This program illustrates the PWM signal on 6 Channels in single edge mode
		 Peripheral clock for PWM: PWM_PCLK = CCLK / 4 = 72MHz/4 = 18MHz and there is no
		 prescale for PWM. The PWM timer/counter clock is at 18MHz. The base rate is set to 256
		 The base PWM frequency is at 18MHz/256 = 70.312 KHz (Period = ~14.22 microsecond)
		 Each PWM channel (1 to 6) will be configured as following:
			 + PWM1.1 = (10/256) (period = 0.56 microsecond)(P2.0)
			 + PWM1.2 = (20/256) (period = 1.11 microsecond)(P2.1)
			 + PWM1.3 = (30/256) (period = 1.67 microsecond)(P2.2)
			 + PWM1.4 = (40/256) (period = 2.22 microsecond)(P2.3)
			 + PWM1.5 = (50/256) (period = 2.78 microsecond)(P2.4)
			 + PWM1.6 = (60/256) (period = 3.33 microsecond)(P2.5)
		 Using Oscilloscope to observe the PWM signals

	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				- The output signal can be observed by oscilloscope on these pins below:
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF

			PWM pin selected:
				Observe PWM wave signal on these pin
				- PWM1.1 (channel 1): P2.0
				- PWM1.2 (channel 2): P2.1
				- PWM1.3 (channel 3): P2.2
				- PWM1.4 (channel 4): P2.3
				- PWM1.5 (channel 5): P2.4
				- PWM1.6 (channel 6): P2.5
										
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Run example	 
				  Use oscilloscope to monitor the wave form on pin P2.0, P2.1, P2.2, P2.3, P2.4, P2.5
				
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > PWM > Single_Edge"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
